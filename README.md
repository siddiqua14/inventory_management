# Inventory Management System

## Overview

The Inventory Management System is a Django-based application designed for managing property data, including locations and accommodations. The system supports geospatial data using PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension, allowing for precise location-based queries. Property owners can sign up to manage their accommodations, and administrators can manage the system through a comprehensive admin interface.

## Features

- **Geospatial Data**: Uses PostGIS for location-based features.
- **Property Management**: Manage accommodations with detailed information, including location, amenities, pricing, and more.
- **User Management**: Property owners can sign up, while administrators can approve their requests and manage properties.
- **CSV Import/Export**: Locations can be imported from CSV via the Django Admin interface.
- **Admin Interface**: A comprehensive Django Admin interface for managing locations, accommodations, and user roles.
- **Command-Line Utility**: A Django CLI command to generate a `sitemap.json` file for country locations.
